## Run 1 — agent.py

**Date:** 2026-04-16  
**Orchestration:** Plain Python loop (`agent.py`)  
**Run ID:** `diJmMJdbDDgR1qAAFF1k`

### Stats
- Baseline val_bpb: **3.4172**
- Final val_bpb: **1.2303**
- Total improvement: **↓ 2.1869 (64%)**
- 80 experiments · 17 kept · 63 reverted · 21% success rate

### val_bpb progression
- **Exp 1–9:** Oscillating near baseline (~3.3–3.5), mostly reverted
- **Exp 10–11:** Major breakthrough — TOTAL_BATCH_SIZE reduction dropped val_bpb from 3.3 → 1.9 in two consecutive kept experiments
- **Exp 12–29:** Stabilizing around 1.8–2.0, agent refining other hyperparameters
- **Exp 30+:** Second step down to ~1.4–1.5
- **Exp 60–80:** Converging around 1.2–1.3, mostly reverted — agent near local minimum

### Key finding
The agent independently discovered that **reducing TOTAL_BATCH_SIZE** is the dominant lever for a time-budgeted T4 run. Smaller batches = more optimizer steps per 5 minutes = faster convergence.

| Experiment | Change | Delta |
|---|---|---|
| Exp 9 | TOTAL_BATCH_SIZE 2^17 → 2^16 | -0.4966 |
| Exp 10 | TOTAL_BATCH_SIZE 2^16 → 2^15 | -0.7983 (best) |
| Exp 11 | TOTAL_BATCH_SIZE 2^15 → 2^14 | further improvement |

Three consecutive kept experiments, each halving the batch size — the agent recognized the pattern and kept pushing.

### Best single change
> **-0.7983** — Experiment 10 showed a massive improvement by reducing TOTAL_BATCH_SIZE from 2^16 to 2^15, giving GRAD_ACCUM_STEPS=2. More optimizer steps in 5 minutes = better convergence.

## Run 2 — flyte_workflow.py

**Date:** 2026-04-17  
**Orchestration:** Flyte 2 tasks (`flyte_workflow.py`)  
**Run ID:** `E35uWNVNPX1Qn1ipAr62`

### Stats
- Baseline val_bpb: **3.6773**
- Final val_bpb: **1.4251**
- Total improvement: **↓ 2.2522 (61%)**
- 58 experiments · 13 kept · 45 reverted · 22% success rate

### val_bpb progression
- **Exp 1–10:** Near baseline, agent exploring architecture and LR space
- **Exp 11:** Major breakthrough — same TOTAL_BATCH_SIZE insight as Run 1, val_bpb dropped sharply
- **Exp 12–40:** Oscillating around 1.6–1.8, agent refining config around the new baseline
- **Exp 40–58:** Steady convergence toward 1.4, mostly reverted late in the run

### Key finding
The agent rediscovered the same insight as Run 1 — **TOTAL_BATCH_SIZE reduction** was the primary driver. Starting from a clean baseline, the agent reached the same conclusion independently by experiment 11.

### Best single change
> **-0.7398** — Experiment 11: reducing TOTAL_BATCH_SIZE from 2^17 to 2^16 gave a strong improvement, suggesting more frequent gradient updates are beneficial within the 5-minute budget for this shallow, fast model.

## Observations

### Both runs converged on the same insight
Without any human guidance, both the `agent.py` loop and the `flyte_workflow.py` loop independently identified that **reducing TOTAL_BATCH_SIZE** is the dominant optimization for a 5-minute training budget on a T4. The agent discovered this by experiment 9–11 in both runs.

### Fewer experiments in Run 2
Run 2 completed 58 experiments vs 80 in Run 1. Likely causes:
- Flyte task orchestration adds small overhead per experiment (~few seconds)
- Slightly higher baseline may have led to longer early exploration

### Similar success rates
Both runs achieved ~21–22% success rate — roughly 1 in 5 proposed changes improved val_bpb. This aligns with the expected difficulty of finding improvements near a local minimum.

### Final val_bpb difference
Run 1 reached 1.2303 vs Run 2's 1.4251. Run 1 had 22 more experiments (more time to explore) and benefited from a slightly lower starting baseline. Given equal experiment counts, both runs would likely converge to similar floors.

### Orchestration is transparent to results
The Flyte workflow produced equivalent results to the plain Python loop — confirming that `core.py` correctly shares the experiment logic between both modes, and Flyte's overhead does not affect the ML outcomes.
